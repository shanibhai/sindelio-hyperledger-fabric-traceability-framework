DCO
===

As per section 13.a of the [Hyperledger Charter](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter) all code submitted to the Hyperledger Foundation needs to have a [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) sign-off.

The sign off needs to be using your legal name, not a pseudonym.  Git has a built-in mechanism to allow this with the `-s` or `--signoff` argument to `git commit` command, providing your `user.name` and `user.email` have been setup correctly.

If you have any questions, you can reach us on [hyperledger-explorer channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer).
